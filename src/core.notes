# mutable structs are a lot faster as keys for an IdDict!

# Tape: valN=>nodeN, ..., val1=>node1, NIL=>node0
# Special node0 marks both ends of the tape: 
# node[n].cdr = node[n-1]
# node1.cdr = node0
# node0.cdr = nodeN
# Special Value NIL acts as a key to node0.
# Tape is iterated in reverse, last in first out
# This automatically makes first(tape) the final result node
# last(tape) is the initial parameter node, but default slow.
# The last(::Tape) hack is to make old style grad faster.
