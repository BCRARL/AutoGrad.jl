	* DONE:
	# @primitive should be type specific.
	# sum_outgrads should not overwrite its arguments: e.g. + may have passed the same dy back to multiple places.
	# separate tests, examples, and gradients.
	# (w,b)=params does not work, implement iterators?

	* TODO:
	# write gradcheck.
	# implement 2arg functions.
	# implement broadcasting functions.
	# implement arraymath functions (transpose etc)
	# implement 3arg (overwriting) functions.
	# test mnist etc. more examples.
	# work on overwriting and efficiency (are closures efficient? nothing instead of zero arrays?).
	# support CudaArrays.
	# implement convenience_wrappers (jacobian etc)?
	# handle broadcast.jl.
	# copying, reshaping, subarrays and concatenation?
	# finish 1arg functions.
